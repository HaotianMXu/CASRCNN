# SRCNN-Tensorflow
Tensorflow implementation of Convolutional Neural Networks for super-resolution. 

## Prerequisites
 * Tensorflow
 * Scipy 
 * h5py

## Workflow
![orig](https://github.com/HaotianMXu/CASRCNN/blob/master/workflow.PNG)<br>

This code requires Tensorflow. Also scipy is used instead of Matlab or OpenCV. Especially, installing OpenCV at Linux is sort of complicated. So, with reproducing this paper, I used scipy instead. For more imformation about scipy, click [here](https://www.scipy.org/).
